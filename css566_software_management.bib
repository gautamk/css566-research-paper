	abstract = {Slack is a modern communication platform for teams that is seeing wide and rapid adoption by software develop-ment teams. Slack not only facilitates team messaging and archiving, but it also supports a wide plethora of inte-grations to external services and bots. We have found that Slack and its integrations (i.e., bots) are playing an increas-ingly signiï¬cant role in software development, replacing email in some cases and disrupting software development processes. To understand how Slack impacts development team dynamics, we designed an exploratory study to inves-tigate how developers use Slack and how they beneï¬t from it. We ï¬nd that developers use Slack for personal, team-wide and community-wide purposes. Our research also reveals that developers use and create diverse integrations (called bots) to support their work. This study serves as the ï¬rst step towards understanding the role of Slack in sup-porting software engineering.},
