	abstract = {Slack is a modern communication platform for teams that is seeing wide and rapid adoption by software develop-ment teams. Slack not only facilitates team messaging and archiving, but it also supports a wide plethora of inte-grations to external services and bots. We have found that Slack and its integrations (i.e., bots) are playing an increas-ingly signi{\"i}{\textlnot}?cant role in software development, replacing email in some cases and disrupting software development processes. To understand how Slack impacts development team dynamics, we designed an exploratory study to inves-tigate how developers use Slack and how they bene{\"i}{\textlnot}?t from it. We {\"i}{\textlnot}?nd that developers use Slack for personal, team-wide and community-wide purposes. Our research also reveals that developers use and create diverse integrations (called bots) to support their work. This study serves as the {\"i}{\textlnot}?rst step towards understanding the role of Slack in sup-porting software engineering.},

	abstract = {A continuous integration system is often considered one of the key elements involved in supporting an agile software development and testing environment. As a traditional software tester transitioning to an agile development environment it became clear to me that I would need to put this essential infrastructure in place and promote improved development practices in order to make the transition to agile testing possible. This experience report discusses a continuous integration implementation I led last year. The initial motivations for implementing continuous integration are discussed and a pre and post-assessment using Martin Fowler's" practices of continuous integration" is provided along with the technical specifics of the implementation. The report concludes with a retrospective of my experiences implementing and promoting continuous integration within the context of agile testing.},

	abstract = {Continuous integration is a software engineering practice of frequently merging all developer working copies with a shared main branch, e.g., several times a day. With the advent of GitHub, a platform well known for its "social coding" features that aid collaboration and sharing, and currently the largest code host in the open source world, collaborative software development has never been more prominent. In GitHub development one can distinguish between two types of developer contributions to a project: direct ones, coming from a typically small group of developers with write access to the main project repository, and indirect ones, coming from developers who fork the main repository, update their copies locally, and submit pull requests for review and merger. In this paper we explore how GitHub developers use continuous integration as well as whether the contribution type (direct versus indirect) and different project characteristics (e.g., main programming language, or project age) are associated with the success of the automatic builds.},

	abstract = {Continuous integration is a software practice where developers integrate frequently, at least daily. While this is an ostensibly simple concept, it does leave ample room for interpretation: what is it the developers integrate with, what happens when they do, and what happens before they do? These are all open questions with regards to the details of how one implements the practice of continuous integration, and it is conceivable that not all such implementations in the industry are alike. In this paper we show through a literature review that there are differences in how the practice of continuous integration is interpreted and implemented from case to case. Based on these findings we propose a descriptive model for documenting and thereby better understanding implementations of the continuous integration practice and their differences. The application of the model to an industry software development project is then described in an illustrative case study.},

In this paper, we advance the state-of-the-art of the research in this area by conducting a survey-based ex-post-facto study for identifying factors from the perspective of the ASD practitioners that will influence the success of projects that adopt ASD practices. In this paper, we describe a hypothetical success factors framework we developed to address our research question, the hypotheses we conjectured, the research methodology, the data analysis techniques we used to validate the hypotheses, and the results we obtained from data analysis. The study was conducted using an unprecedentedly large-scale survey-based methodology, consisting of respondents who practice ASD and who had experience practicing plan-driven software development in the past. The study indicates that nine of the 14 hypothesized factors have statistically significant relationship with {\textquotedblleft}Success{\textquotedblright}. The important success factors that were found are: customer satisfaction, customer collaboration, customer commitment, decision time, corporate culture, control, personal characteristics, societal culture, and training and learning.},

	abstract = {Stack Overflow is a popular on-line programming question and answer community providing its participants with rapid access to knowledge and expertise of their peers, especially benefitting coders. Despite the popularity of Stack Overflow, its role in the work cycle of open-source developers is yet to be understood: on the one hand, participation in it has the potential to increase the knowledge of individual developers thus improving and speeding up the development process. On the other hand, participation in Stack Overflow may interrupt the regular working rhythm of the developer, hence also possibly slow down the development process. In this paper we investigate the interplay between Stack Overflow activities and the development process, reflected by code changes committed to the largest social coding repository, GitHub. Our study shows that active GitHub committers ask fewer questions and provide more answers than others. Moreover, we observe that active Stack Overflow askers distribute their work in a less uniform way than developers that do not ask questions. Finally, we show that despite the interruptions incurred, the Stack Overflow activity rate correlates with the code changing activity in GitHub.},
