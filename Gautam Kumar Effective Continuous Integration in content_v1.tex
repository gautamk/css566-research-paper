\section*{Abstract}
Continous Integration is considered an integral part of Agile developement. CI 
is often thought to be a safety net that prevents developers from deploying 
broken code to production. 

Writing code is a creative exercise where developers organise instructions on 
a logical order for computers to execute. This process is not unlike writing 
content where authors organise information in a logical order for humans to 
understand. Developers work collaboratively and so do authors. Computer 
programs are expected to conform to a syntax and structure, while article are 
have rules on spelling, grammar and structure. Based on these similarities a 
CI system designed for writers and authors could potentially save hundreds of 
hours of work by an editor scrutinizing mundane details of an article.

This paper aims to analyse the potential benifits of authors adopting a CI 
from the perspective of a team of writers collaboratively working on a single 
project.
