\section*{CI in Software Management}

\citationneeded

Continuous integration has been well defined from the software development perspective, definitions from the side of Software Management on the other hand are quite sparse. 

The value of Continuous integration can only be seen in an organisation that values continuous improvement of the organisation as a whole as opposed to merely using CI as a tool for software development.

The easiest area to define Continuous Integration within the scope of Software management would be Process Management. CI in terms of Process Management could be thought of as a way to verify that all internal processes within an organisation comply with the expectation and solve the intended problem. Some potential implications of a meta-process of Continuous Integration could be weeding out of complicated processes which affect productivity, Simplifying processes to reduce bottlenecks and potentially automation to simplify implementation and verification. There are many tools especially in the BPMN space which offer a simple way to automate and integration internal processes with existing infrastructure. 

\section*{Implementing CI in Software Management}

Continuous Integration and Improvement by nature is an iterative process thus implementing within the context of Software management requires the management team to follow a disciplined process of continuous evaluation and an evolution.

\subsection*{Adoption}
The initial adoption process of any new Software management model would be significantly different from integrating new team members into an existing model. For example, some the factors which affect the success of adopting Agile methodologies in an organisation are 
Customer collaboration, satisfaction and commitment, Communication and negotiation skills of the team and Cultural factors \cite{misra_identifying_2009}.

These success factors differ when brining in new team members. For example a team member fresh out of college might adapt to an existing process at an organisation with ease while a seasoned developer who is loyal to the waterfall model might have a hard time adapting to the rapid pace of an agile organisation. 

As teams being to understand the expectations of their customers and their organisations the previously defined software process evolves thus as time goes on each team / organisation starts building a unique variation of the agile process.

In this context initial adoption is usually the easiest task as the whole team is collectively working towards making sure that Agile adoption succeeds. Adoption by new team members on the other hand depends on the new team member, the Software management team and the culture of the organisation.

It is the responsibility of the software management team to enable new developers to adopt and adapt to the unique process of the dev team they are going to be working with.

\subsection*{Success criteria} The software management team needs to have a clear and evolving success criteria which monitors the each new hire and how well they are able to adapt to their new teams. This differs from Definition of Done (DoD) based on the fact that DoD is merely a set of activities which need to be performed to get the user story to a shippable state while Success criteria is a broader set of expectations from the candidate which are recorded based on subjective observations.
